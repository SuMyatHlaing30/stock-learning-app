Unlike fundamental analysis, which looks at a company's business fundamentals, technical analysis focuses solely on price movements and chart patterns.</p></div><h3>The Core Principles of Technical Analysis</h3><ol><li><strong>Price Discounts Everything</strong>: Technical analysts believe that all known information about a stock is already reflected in its price.</li><li><strong>Prices Move in Trends</strong>: Once a trend is established, future price movements are more likely to follow the trend than go against it.</li><li><strong>History Tends to Repeat Itself</strong>: Market patterns and movements tend to repeat over time due to market psychology.</li></ol><h3>Key Technical Indicators</h3><h4>Trend Indicators</h4><ul><li><strong>Moving Averages</strong>: The average price over a specific period (e.g., 50-day, 200-day). Used to identify trends and potential support/resistance levels.<ul><li>When price is above the moving average: Generally bullish</li><li>When price is below the moving average: Generally bearish</li><li>When shorter-term MA crosses above longer-term MA: Bullish signal (\"Golden Cross\")</li><li>When shorter-term MA crosses below longer-term MA: Bearish signal (\"Death Cross\")</li></ul></li><li><strong>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</strong>: Shows the relationship between two moving averages and can identify momentum, trend directions, and potential reversals.</li><li><strong>Trend Lines</strong>: Lines drawn connecting a series of highs or lows to visualize the trend direction.</li></ul><h4>Momentum Indicators</h4><ul><li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</strong>: Measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100.<ul><li>RSI above 70: Potentially overbought</li><li>RSI below 30: Potentially oversold</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stochastic Oscillator</strong>: Compares a stock's closing price to its price range over a specific period.<ul><li>Above 80: Potentially overbought</li><li>Below 20: Potentially oversold</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Volume Indicators</h4><ul><li><strong>Volume</strong>: The number of shares traded in a given period. Strong price movements with high volume are typically more significant.</li><li><strong>On-Balance Volume (OBV)</strong>: Adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days to show buying/selling pressure.</li><li><strong>Volume Price Trend (VPT)</strong>: Similar to OBV but considers the percentage price change.</li></ul><h4>Volatility Indicators</h4><ul><li><strong>Bollinger Bands</strong>: Shows a range around the price where it typically trades, based on volatility.<ul><li>Price approaching upper band: Potentially overbought</li><li>Price approaching lower band: Potentially oversold</li><li>Bands narrowing: Decreased volatility, potential for significant move</li><li>Bands widening: Increased volatility</li></ul></li><li><strong>Average True Range (ATR)</strong>: Measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of a stock's price for that period.</li></ul><h3>Chart Patterns</h3><h4>Reversal Patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Head and Shoulders</strong>: A chart formation with three peaks (the middle peak is highest) that often signals a trend reversal from bullish to bearish.</li><li><strong>Double Tops/Bottoms</strong>: When a price reaches the same level twice and reverses, often indicating a potential trend change.</li><li><strong>Rounding Tops/Bottoms</strong>: Gradual, curved reversal patterns that can indicate a slow shift in momentum.</li></ul><h4>Continuation Patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Flags and Pennants</strong>: Short-term consolidation patterns that usually continue in the direction of the previous trend.</li><li><strong>Triangles</strong>: Patterns where price converges into a narrower range, indicating a potential breakout.<ul><li>Ascending Triangle: Generally bullish</li><li>Descending Triangle: Generally bearish</li><li>Symmetrical Triangle: Direction depends on breakout</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rectangles</strong>: Price bounces between parallel support and resistance levels before continuing the trend.</li></ul><h4>Candlestick Patterns</h4><p>Candlestick charts show the open, high, low, and close prices for a specific time period and can form recognizable patterns.</p><ul><li><strong>Doji</strong>: Open and close prices are almost equal, indicating indecision.</li><li><strong>Hammer</strong>: Small body with a long lower shadow, potential bullish reversal.</li><li><strong>Engulfing Pattern</strong>: When a candle's body completely engulfs the previous candle, suggesting a potential reversal.</li><li><strong>Morning Star/Evening Star</strong>: Three-candle patterns that can indicate reversal.</li></ul><h3>Support and Resistance</h3><ul><li><strong>Support</strong>: A price level where a stock tends to stop falling as buying pressure increases.</li><li><strong>Resistance</strong>: A price level where a stock tends to stop rising as selling pressure increases.</li><li>When support or resistance levels are broken, they often switch roles (former support becomes resistance and vice versa).</li></ul><h3>How to Apply Technical Analysis</h3><ol><li><strong>Identify the Trend</strong>: Determine whether the stock is in an uptrend, downtrend, or trading sideways.</li><li><strong>Find Support and Resistance Levels</strong>: Identify key price levels where the stock has historically reversed.</li><li><strong>Look for Chart Patterns</strong>: Recognize patterns that might indicate continuation or reversal.</li><li><strong>Confirm with Indicators</strong>: Use technical indicators to confirm what you see in the price chart.</li><li><strong>Set Entry and Exit Points</strong>: Determine where to buy and sell based on your analysis.</li><li><strong>Manage Risk</strong>: Set stop-loss orders and position sizes based on technical levels.</li></ol><h3>Advantages of Technical Analysis</h3><ul><li>Can be applied to any tradable asset with price data</li><li>Works across different time frames (day trading to long-term investing)</li><li>Provides specific entry and exit points</li><li>Can help with risk management by identifying key levels</li></ul><h3>Limitations of Technical Analysis</h3><ul><li>Based on probabilities, not certainties</li><li>Subject to interpretation and confirmation bias</li><li>Doesn't account for unexpected events (earnings surprises, news, etc.)</li><li>Can generate false signals, especially in choppy markets</li></ul><div class=\"callout\"><p><strong>Note</strong>: Many successful investors use a combination of technical and fundamental analysis. Technical analysis can help with timing and risk management, while fundamental analysis helps ensure you're investing in quality companies.</p></div>",

      "question": "What does the RSI indicator measure?",
      "options": [
        "A company's profitability",
        "The strength of a price trend relative to similar stocks",
        "The speed and magnitude of price movements on a scale of 0-100",
        "The average price over a specific period"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and magnitude of price movements on a scale of 0-100. Values above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions, while values below 30 may indicate oversold conditions."

      "options": [
        "When a stock price falls below its all-time low",
        "When a company announces bankruptcy",

        "A candlestick pattern that predicts severe price drops"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A 'Death Cross' occurs when a shorter-term moving average (typically the 50-day) crosses below a longer-term moving average (typically the 200-day). It's considered a bearish signal that may indicate a potential downtrend."

      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "While fundamental analysts believe company fundamentals determine price movements, technical analysts focus solely on price and volume data, believing that all information (including fundamentals) is already reflected in the price."
